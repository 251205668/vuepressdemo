## The social impact of the 5g era
 4g era, China in many aspects of the world, the economic development, people's lives change, social efficiency improvement, social cost decline has played a very important role,
 5g era, human beings will enter a mobile Internet, intelligent sensing, big data, intelligent learning integrated the era of the intelligent Internet. In the 5g era, mobile connectivity is fundamentally addressed, fundamentally breaking through the ability to transmit information, enabling intelligent sensing, big data and intelligent learning to be fully realized.
## Three scenes for the 5g
  5g Scenes International Organization for Standardization 3GPP defines three scenarios:**eMBB**---3D/Ultra HD video **mMTC**---the large-scale Internet of Things business;**uRLLC**---driverless, industrial automation requires a low latency and high-reliable connectivity.
## eMBB
  Enhanced mobile broadband refers to the existing mobile broadband scene, the user experience speed greatly improved, today we use 4g network, the average user's actual experience rate of 8Mbps download 60Mbps, this speed is far from meeting the needs of users, the experience is not good enough, especially for large live traffic video can not provide high-definition video in the location of the people focus can not be achieved if the road theory 1Gmbps user experience will be qualitatively improved.
## eMTC
  One of the most important values of the Internet of Everything,5g, is that it breaks through the communication between people and machines, machines and machines. A large number of IoT applications require communication, IoT communication has two basic requirements, low power consumption and massive intervention.
  EMTC provides the ability to reduce power consumption to base levels, allowing a large number of IoT devices to be deployed without charging for a month or more.
## uRLLC
 Ultra-high reliable low latency communication technology. In traditional communication, the requirements for reliability are relatively low, but driverless, industrial robots, soft intelligent production lines, but the higher requirements for communication, such communications must be reliable, low latency.The so-called high reliability is that the network must maintain high-speed stability, to ensure that in the process of operation, will not be congested, will not search for interference, not often receive a variety of external influences. **4g network latency is best only 20ms,but uRLLC requires a delay of 1-10ms,which provides high-speed and stable high-security communication capabilities, thus ensuring that driverless industrial technology is safe and stable.**
**To quote a quote from the Tesla ceo at the launch.**

  **So the general indication is that driverless technology may not be mature , and that all may still have to wait for the 5g era of official commercialization . Let's wait and see**
